                    <p> Due to her training as a ceramist and an engraver, drawings occupy a very important place in her works. Never acquired, but constantly questioned, Yasmine Hamrouni is interested in its technical and historical evolution, and wonders above all about the place it can occupy « technique is a basic need in inspiration and influence ». </br> 
                       She thus questions the notion of “memory'' , but also that of the “Intime ”, of the confrontation of the “innersole ” against the “out self ”, of the “soul” and of the “intern ”, of the “extern ”. , of the “story ”, and of “what remains of it”… until a form of linear structure which takes, over time, the form takes a shapes of incomprehensible drawings sometimes to a unique expression explained by the viewer. </br>

                       many occasions such as Elbirou Art Gallery, El Koubah Museum
